Some git tips

I recommend that you fork this repo so you make a copy in you own
account.  Then you can add stuff to your copy of the repo. Just hit
the "Fork" button in the upper left.

Then clone your repository
> git clone https://github.com/whateveritis

Once you have your own repo and you want to put a file on your local
repository back up on git, go to the directory of this README and type
the following:

> git status
> git add subdirectory/filename
> git commit -m "some text to say what you are committing"
> git push

At some point if you'd like to get the latest stuff from this master
repo (it's a good idea make sure your own repository is up to date
first), type the following:

> git remote add upstream https://github.com/cmbitz/HackyHours
> git fetch upstream
> git merge upstream/master

or we think equivalently 

> git remote add upstream https://github.com/cmbitz/HackyHours
> git pull upstream master


---------------------- the following is not recommended ----

However if you don't want to add stuff to the master you can just do
the following.

To "clone" or download a copy of this repo on your local computer, go
to a place you'd like to put it on your local harddrive. Then type the
command below. FYI, you don't need to fork the repo (which means to
duplicate the repo on GitHub under your account) since you are welcome
to have write access to this "group" repo.

> git clone https://github.com/cmbitz/HackyHours


If you want to put a file on the repo (and CC has added you as a
contributor so you have write access), go to the directory of this
README and type the following:

> git status
> git add subdirectory/filename
> git commit -m "some text to say what you are committing"
> git push
